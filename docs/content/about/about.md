TensorMap is a web application that will allow the users to create machine learning algorithms visually. TensorMap supports reverse engineering of the visual layout to a Tensorflow implementation in preferred languages. The goal of the project is to let the beginners play with machine learning algorithms in Tensorflow without less background knowledge about the library.

## Sample Overview
![demo_gif](/demo_v2.gif)

## Listed below are the main functions of Tensormap
* Create neural network architecture using drag and drop interface.
    * Create different nodes(input, hidden, output) by dropping to the workspace.
    * Link different nodes that define flow to data and model.
    * Define different parameters associated with nodes and layers.
    * Manually update and retrieve weight of links.
    * Specify model compilation and execution configuration (like learning rate, optimizer, etc)
    * View Runtime results.
    * Get the generated code.
* Upload data of CSV format and visualize metrics of the dataset
* Specify dataset and experiment related configurations like:
    * Features
    * Labels
    * Test percentage
    * Number of epochs
    * Batch size
    * Optimizer (Adam optimization)
* Download the code that was auto-generated according to the created model
* Execute the created model and show the progress
* Show the resultant metric values
